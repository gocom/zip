Testing Rah/Zip
============

The project uses [PHPunit](http://phpunit.de) for running its unit tests. Before running the tests, make sure you've installed dev-requirements using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    $ composer install --dev

 To run a test execute PHPunit and boom:

    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
